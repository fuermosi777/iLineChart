# iLineChart
Quickly implement & easily customize great looking line charts.


## Get Started
```swift
import SwiftUI
import iLineChart

struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
      iLineChart(data: [8,32,11,23,40,28,15,20,30,25])
  }
}
```

## Examples 
### Example 1
Enable chart statistics to make your chart & its data interactive.
Add a title to give your chart some context.
```swift
import SwiftUI
import iLineChart

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        iLineChart(
            data: [8,32,11,23,40,28,15,20,30,25],
            title: "My Graph",
            displayChartStats: true
        )
    }
}
```

<h3> Example 2</h2>
Utalize the built in ExampleData to test your chart with sophisticated data.
Set curvedLines to false to give your stocks graph a more realistic feel.
Choose style: .tertiary for a minimalist chart aesthetic.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import iLineChart

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        iLineChart(
            data: [8,32,11,23,40,28,15,20,30,25],
            title: "My Graph",
            displayChartStats: true
        )
    }
}
```

<h3> Example 3</h2>
Change the cursor color with the built in iColor library.
Enable fullscreen to cover the safe areas with your background color.
Change the font to your company's brand.

```swift
import SwiftUI
import iLineChart
import iColor

struct ContentView: View {
    var data:[Double] = ExampleData.stockData

    var body: some View {
        iLineChart(
            data: data,
            title: "My Dark Themed App",
            subtitle: "Sleek. Simple.",
            style: .dark,
            titleColor: Color.neonRed,
            cursorColor: .black,
            titleFont: .system(size: 14, weight: .regular, design: .monospaced),
            subtitleFont: .system(size: 24, weight: .bold, design: .monospaced),
            fullScreen: true
        )
    }
}
```
